### Inspiration

  <details>

**THE IDEA:** Kichi's World has been created as a group project in the full-stack development program at the Code wild school with [Bryan Blair](http://https://github.com/BryanClawdBlair).

<ins>This project is inspired by two iconic applications:</ins>:

- [Tamagucci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi) use to be in the 90's a poplar virtual pet, where the user supposed to feed it, play with it, and of course clean the poo:) A decent solution for kids, that their parents didn't allow them pets at home
- [Habitica](https://habitica.com/) an open source gamilfy application, with a RPG astatic, where the user earn coins & experience points by completing tasks and decrease heath by not completing the tasks.

**THE UX/UI INSPIRATION:** The app is inspired by the colorful japanese esthetic, with self-made icons using _Photoshop_ & _Figma_. The goal it to make the UX goals were to taking care to all the small details on the screen to maximize the engagement of the user.

<summery>verification logic by registration</summery>

  <details>

![Registration Screen](./images/../src/assets/images/screenshots/registration.png)

```
const validate = () => {
    console.log(userName, email, password, conPassword);

    // #### conditions for the form validation
    // 1. user name
    if (userName.length > 1) {
      setEUserName('');
      setUColor('green');
    } else {
      setEUserName('Username must contain at least 8 characters');
      setUColor('red');
    }

    // 2. email
    if (email.includes('@') && email.includes('.com')) {
      setEEmail('');
      setEColor('green');
    } else {
      setEEmail('Must be a valid email address');
      setEColor('red');
    }

    // 3. password
    if (password.length > 4) {
      setEPassword('');
      setPColor('green');
    } else {
      setEPassword('Please enter a password with at least 8 digits');
      setPColor('red');
    }

    // 4. confirm password
    if (password !== '' && password === conPassword) {
      setEConPassword('');
      setConPcolor('green');
    } else {
      setEConPassword('Passwords not matched');
      setConPcolor('red');
    }
  };

<summery>Responsiveness of the website</summery>

<details>

![Responsiveness](/src/assets/images/screenshots/responsive.png)

<p>Using two media queries sizes for medium and small screen. the goal is to make it responsive in the main code, and make small changes to maximize the ux</p>

```
/* ===================== MEDIA QUERIES (MEDIUM DEVICES) =========================*/
@media screen and (max-width: 1024px) {
  .kichi-logo {
    right: -4%;
    top: -5%;
  }
}

/* ===================== MEDIA QUERIES (SMALL DEVICES) ========================= */
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  .top-stage {
    gap: 2rem;
  }}

```

</details><br>

<summery>Using localStorage</summery>

<details>

![Responsiveness](/src/assets/images/screenshots/responsive.png)

<p>Using localStorage to save the information of the user for the login</p>

```
  const handleLogin = () => {

    // ### localStorage ####
    // getting the item from the localStorage and convert it to JS syntax
    // this item has been created in the registration page
    const users = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('users'));

    // Using the For of loop, optional since the ES6
    // Looping through all the users to find a match with the user & the password
    //it's true, then iterate by one and show me the message
    let i = 0;
    for (let el of users) {
      if (el.email === email && el.password === password) {
        i++;
      }
    }

    //### START CONDITION to login to the Dashboard ####
    //if the variable i ==== 1, it means that there is a match with the login and the password

    if (i === 1) {

      // ### LocalStorage ###
      // 1.  set 2 new items in the localStorage
      alert('Login Successful');
      localStorage.setItem('loggedIn', 'yes');
      localStorage.setItem('currentUser', email);

      // 2. Set the time after the login
      const today = new Date();
      const currentTime =
        today.getFullYear() +
        '-' +
        (today.getMonth() + 1) +
        '-' +
        (today.getDay() + 1);

      // ### LocalStorage ###
      // 3. Get the user item,  currentUser and convert it to js
      let localEntry = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('users'));
      let currentUserEntry = localStorage.getItem('currentUser');

      // 4. Using fine index to find the position of the users email in the array
      // in order to add read and add information
      //getting the index number
      let index = localEntry.findIndex(
        (element) => element.email === currentUserEntry
      );

      // 5. Add another property to the existing object in the index position
      // currentTime is the timeStamp of the login
      localEntry[index] = {
        ...localEntry[index],
        time: currentTime,
        //hp: currentUserHP,
      };

      // ### localStorage ###
      // 6. Replace the item users with the new information (the currentTime property)
      localStorage.setItem('users', JSON.stringify(localEntry));

```

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- React.js
- JavaScript

  <br><hr>

### What I learned

- How to make a website responsive with small changes using grid, flex & media query
- How to use the localStorage to win a stored data, that can be used also after refreshing the page
- How to structure the React application with reusable components by using dynamic, conditional props

<hr><br>

### Continued development

I would like to continue maximizing the Sass use in the project by manufacturing the code by:

- Create a homepage with an introduction of the website
- Improve the game option by adding a screen to check the stats: points & completing tasks
- Continue manufacturing the code, make it dry but readable as possible

<hr><br>

### Useful resources

- [Responsiveness ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ohtVzCSHqs&t=2s) - This helped me for the responsiveness in the website. I really recommend in general about Kevin Powell's content.
- [LocalStorage](https://youtu.be/6eFwtaZf6zc) - This tutorial helped me to increase my knowledge and understanding the features of the localStorage, using the common methods:setItem,
  getItem, removeItem, clear.
